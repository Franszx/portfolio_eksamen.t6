            <strong>Fun fact history:</strong> The word pizza was first
            documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively in different parts of
            Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by
            emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied
            troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other
            Italian foods.
