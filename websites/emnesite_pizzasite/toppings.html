              <p>
                Pecorino Romano is a hard, salty Italian cheese, often used for
                grating, made with sheep's milk. Pecorino Romano means directly
                translated "sheep's [cheese] of Rome".

              </div>
              <p>
                Pecorino is often used on pasta dishes, its distinctive aromatic
                and pleasantly sharp, very salty flavour led to it being
                preferred for some Italian pasta dishes with highly flavoured
                sauces, especially those of Roman origin, such as bucatini
                all'amatriciana, spaghetti alla carbonara, pasta alla gricia,
                and spaghetti cacio e pepe (which it is a main ingredient in
                this dish). The sharpness depends on the period of maturation,
                which varies from five months for a table cheese to eight months
                or longer for a grating cheese. Most pecorino cheeses are
                classified as grana and are granular, hard and sharply flavored.

              <h3>Mozzarella</h3>
              <p>
                Buffalo mozzarella, is a mozzarella made from the milk of
                Italian Mediterranean buffalo. It is a dairy product
                traditionally manufactured in Campania, especially in the
                provinces of Caserta and Salerno. Buffalo mozzarella is eaten
                with calzone, vegetable, salad, on pizza (a low moisture content
                buffalo mozzarella is preferred), on grilled bread, with
                tomatoes, or by itself accompanied by olive oil.

              <p>
                San Marzano tomatoes are thin and more pointy. The flesh is much
                thicker with fewer seeds, and the taste is stronger, sweeter,
                and less acidic. San Marzano tomatoes have been designated as
                the only tomatoes that can be used for Vera Pizza Napoletana
                (True Neapolitan Pizza). Then you know what to get when you are

              <h3>Pepperoni or Salami</h3>
              <p>
                Pepperoni is an American variety of spicy salami made from cured
                pork and beef seasoned with paprika or other chili pepper. Prior
                to cooking, pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly
                smoky, and bright red.[1] Thinly sliced pepperoni is one of the
                most popular pizza toppings in American pizzerias.
                <em>Delicious!</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Pepperoni</strong>, an Italian-American creation, is a
                cured dry sausage, with similarities to the spicy salamis of
                southern Italy on which it is based, such as salsiccia or
                soppressata. Pepperoni is usually softer in texture, and is
                usually produced with the use of an artificial casing.

              <h3>Prosciutto/ Ham</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Prosciutto</strong> or Prosciutto crudo, is Italian
                uncooked, unsmoked, and dry-cured ham. Prosciutto crudo is
                usually served thinly sliced. Sliced prosciutto crudo in Italy
                is often served as an antipasto(starters), wrapped around
                grissini, or accompanied with melon or figs. It is also eaten as
                accompaniment to cooked spring vegetables, such as asparagus or
                peas. It may be included in a simple pasta sauce made with
                cream, or a Tuscan dish of tagliatelle and vegetables. It is
                used in stuffings for other meats, such as veal, as a wrap
                around veal or steak, in a filled bread, and as a pizza topping.

            <strong>Fun fact</strong>: pineapple on pizza - Hawaiian pizza is a
            pizza originating in Canada, and is traditionally topped with
            pineapple, tomato sauce, cheese, and either ham or bacon. at first
            it was not popular but became localy popular and later global. The
            name of this creation is, in fact, actually not directly inspired by
            the U.S. state of Hawaii at all; it is said that the creator chose
            the name Hawaiian after the brand of canned pineapple he was using
            at the time.
